			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			<p class="mb block">It is easy to Authenticate a User. As long as you have a Database. In our Hacker Dojo database (hacker_blog) We have already created a table called <b>user</b>. This has all of our User information for this next step. </p>
			<p class="mb block">
				We are going to create a user with our Name (user_first_name user_last_name) with a username of (hakerdojo) and a password of (sha1('hackerdojo2010')). Sha1 encryptions are hugely powerful AES based encryptions. You can utilize this for free!
				<br class="mt">
				<b>Note:</b> You can find out what the encryption value of something is by doing SELECT sha1('text') in your MySQL IDE.
